# Hathers-Drunken-Hole-Minekhan-Build
This is my custom build in a clone of Minekhan, in an effort to try and revive Minekhan. This is Hathers Drunken Hole, where the beggars go to thrive, alongside those of worth and nobility, through the evils of wealth. Uncover the stories of the tavern that saw the many dynasties' rise and fall. The world of Havers has seen its fall, and the last that stands of it is the tavern on the hill, Hathers Hole. The tavern has been a staging ground for multiple crimes of thieves and those of noblest triumphs. We shall not see that fall of this tavern will never come. Go on, adventurer, have your shots, but don't get that tongue tied, you won't read this, but I know some of you will.
